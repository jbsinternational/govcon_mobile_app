We will also introduce analysis outputs from the research that are geared towards understanding and segmenting the target audience in order to interpret user requirements and drive strategic design decisions.\n\nConduct user research in the field\u00a0- It is commonly known in the usability research field that users will describe a task one way and perform it quite differently. All too often requirements are built based on how users describe their tasks and the product that is delivered does not meet their actual needs. When users are observed doing their day-to-day tasks, the resulting set of requirements is much more accurate, and will end up producing a higher quality product.\n\nKnow who your users are and how they behave\u00a0- To make the data captured during contextual inquiry actionable we create personas and user typologies. Personas are used to help focus a team on a specific audience and provide concrete data on user archetypes. A User Typology visually describes the different ways your users interact with and consume information. It focuses on identifying and grouping users based on behavior - regardless of their persona or role.\n\nThese artifacts help the development team stay focused on, a) who the users are and b) how the system needs to be designed and built to meet users needs need, throughout the development process. We will use scenarios and deliverables pulled from past project work to demonstrate the success of both these processes.","day":"Friday","exp_level":"Intermediate","room":"Balcony C","session_track":"Front-end, UX, & Design","speakers":"mtaylor@limina-ao.com","time_slot":"2:00pm to 2:45pm"}},{"node":{"nid":"99","title":"Security and Scanning - an Open Source Approach","body":"All three branches of the Federal Government \u00a0and many state and local governments are turning to Drupal to provide a cost-effective and secure internet presence.

You have to inventory your content, get agreement from content owners\u00a0on\u00a0how much you're keeping/rewriting (and\u00a0deleting!), decide what content types fit your content, get it into Drupal with a mix of automated and manual migration,\u00a0set up redirects to avoid breaking old links, and\u00a0perform serious QA.\n\nScenario 2:\u00a0You're migrating from an old CMS with clunky content types and fields to a new Drupal one that's much more tailored to your needs.\u00a0You're migrating 400 pages from your old CMS as-is, and overhauling 20-30 of those pages with new content. You're going to spend time massaging your old fields and taxonomy to get them into your new structure.\n\nScenario 3:\u00a0You're condensing 5 sites into one. Three are static; two are in CMSes. You know you're going to need a content audit to identify redundant and out-of-date content. Your biggest concerns are making sure your new, consolidated site is built on a sound content strategy, getting your content owners to understand and adopt that strategy,\u00a0and having a content migration plan that shows you what content's going to end up where and how it's going to get there (Migrate module for the CMSes? Scraping for the static sites? Can we get some interns?).\n\nScenario 4:\u00a0You're migrating content one-to-one from your old CMS to your shiny new Drupal one. Your fields line up in Drupal with what they were in the last CMS. You don't have plans to significantly overhaul your content. You are lucky, and this session is not for you.\n\nIf you're dealing with Scenarios 1-3, you'll have to sink time into content strategy and migration planning. This session will talk about:\n\n\n\tContent inventories\u00a0to detail out your content and your assets -- and to lay the basis for a redirect strategy to preserve your links\n\tContent audits\u00a0to determine the quality of your content,\u00a0how much of it should migrate, and how you need to involve content owners\n\tContent mapping\u00a0to show how content will be translated into Drupal fields, and to help guide site-building\n\tTypes of migration techniques\u00a0and when to use each\n\tMigration QA\u00a0using manual & automated methods, and how to design your QA approach\n\n\nWhile this session won't get into the technical side of automating migration with\u00a0Migrate, it will help you with the planning you'll need to do in advance to make that automated migration a smooth one\u00a0-- and the QA techniques you can use to make sure it worked.\n\nThis session will be presented by\u00a0Kat Kuhl (Director of Technology at CHIEF/Rock Creek Strategic Marketing) and\u00a0Samantha Elliott (Lead Associate\u00a0at\u00a0Phase One Consulting Group), who will share insights from working with clients that include the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Agency for International Development,\u00a0and the\u00a0Department of Transportation.","day":"Friday","exp_level":"Beginner","room":"Room A","session_track":"Site Building","speakers":"webbykat, samantha.elliott@gmail.com","time_slot":"1:00pm to 1:45pm"}},{"node":{"nid":"91","title":"Leveraging Personas To Enhance the Citizen Experience on Government Websites","body":"In the world of Web 1.0, it was considered a perk for a government agency to have a workable, public-facing website where citizens could access information or even potentially complete various tasks. As members of the Web 2.0 world, however, we no longer view real-time access to information as a perk but, rather, as a necessity.\n\nGovernment websites have certainly begun to embrace technology in order to enhance transparency and customer service, but many websites have a long way to go as they work to bridge the gaps between government services and the people that need them. This can include anything from intuitive navigational paths that allow users to easily complete tasks to streamlined content that facilitates user understanding and surfaces the most relevant information. By taking a user-centered approach to building government websites, however, government agencies can truly begin to enhance the citizen experience. Persona development\u2014or the creation of hypothetical yet realistic and\u00a0detailed representations of individual users\u2014is one of the most effective strategies for building websites that enhance the citizen experience, both through targeted and personalized content, as well as through more user-focused information architecture structures.

Website builds and rebuilds represent huge investments of resources, and keeping a site relevant for as long as possible is the clearest way to improve the initial ROI.\n\nThere are technical challenges to keeping an aging site alive, as all too often sites groaning with technical debt make additional feature development increasingly expensive. There are logistical challenges, too: \u00a0the investment necessary to maintain a site can fluctuate from minimal security updates to substantial feature development. The only thing you can accurately predict about production support is that the work will not arrive in a steady, predictable stream.\n\nA key challenge for a website owner is how to right-size the production support investment, rapidly ramping up and scaling back when necessary. For development shops, production support is often seen as a loss-leader: \u00a0strategically important to be well-positioned for a client\u2019s next major build, but not a strong and steady revenue stream.\n\nWe see consulting and support as an opportunity and a task that requires its own process; and we see the skillset necessary as its own discipline.

Drupal has core strengths that line up with key needs, but there are things it doesn\u2019t do well. How do you make sure that you\u2019re not asking Drupal to do too much?

If your project needs to stretch Drupal to its breaking point, how do you mitigate the technical, project management, and business impacts? How do you weigh the pros and cons of using Drupal when you are planning a project, and what are the key warning signs in an RFP that warn against it?
